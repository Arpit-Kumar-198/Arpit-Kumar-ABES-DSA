# Arpit-Kumar-ABES-DSA

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** repository! This is where I share everything I've learned over the past **1.5 years**, alongside future projects and practice work.

##  Repository Overview

- **Purpose**  
  This repo documents my learning path in DSA—from revisiting the fundamentals to mastering advanced concepts. Whether you're a beginner exploring DSA or curious about my journey, you're in the right place.

- **What You'll Find Here**  
  Organized topic-wise into folders such as:
  - `Arrays`
  - `LinkedList`
  - `Recursion`
  - `Dynamic Programming (DP)`
  - `Graphs` / `Heaps` / `Greedy` / `Searching` / `Sorting`
  - `Tree` (BST, Binary Tree)
  - `OOP concepts`, `Functions and Pointers`
  - `STL` (C++ Standard Template Library)
  - `Pattern Printing`, `Math & Prime Numbers`, and more.
  - Helpful reference files like `DSA-Sheets.txt` and `Aptitude-Topics.txt`

- **Technology Stack**  
  - All solutions are written in **C++**.

##  My Journey & Highlights

- Documenting a **1.5-year learning journey** in DSA.
- Gradually expanding from beginner-level topics (loops, arrays) to advanced topics (DP, graph algorithms).
- Regularly structured, topic-focused approach to practice and revision.
