        1. Multigraph : Undirected, multiple edges possible between 2 vertices and edge to itself also possible 

        2. Simple Graph : Undirected, multiple edges and loops are not allowed

        3. Complete Graph : each node is connected to all other nodes directly

        4. Connected Graph : We have direct or indirect path for any possible pair of vertices

        Path : Path is also a graph whose vertices can be arranged in a sequence
        Cycle : Cycle is also a graph whose vertices can be arranged in a cyclic 
        sequence


        5. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) : Directed graph without cycle
        6. Degree : Degree of a vertex is a total no of edges incident to it or away from it 

        Indegree : No. of Incoming edges
        Outdegree : No. of Outgoing edges


        7. Tree is also a graph which never contain cycle
            No of edge = No of node - 1

            Tree is a connected graph
            Min no of edge in connected graph : No of node - 1

        8. Undirected Complete graph edges = vC2 = v! / (2! * (v-2)!)

        9. Directed Complete Graph edges = v * |v-1|                     (max)
